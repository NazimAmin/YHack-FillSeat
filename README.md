# YHack-FillSeat
Fill those last few seats on your flight.

##Inspiration
We were inspired by JetBlue's search for efficiency in travel.

##What it does
It provides incentives for users to purchase the remaining few tickets for flights.

##How I built it
Built with an Angular front end and a nodejs RESTful API backend. This provides extensibility beyond webapps, into mobile apps and other platforms. We built our dataset of JetBlue flights then calculated the deals based on the destinations and the origins and as well as filling the maximum number of seats possible in a flight.

##Challenges I ran into
Creating our own data model and services.

##Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The beautiful reactive design of our website.

##What I learned
Prioritize key features of the finished product.

##What's next for FillSeat
Expand beyond webapps, provide more personalized deals (eg: for veterans) and solve this problem for more than just flights.
